        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shrimp Fried Rice is one of my favorites, it is a quick and easy recipe using ingredients most households that consistently cook have readily available. The best part is that it is even better with leftover rice giving you an excellent way to use leftovers as opposed to wasting them. Combine with lemons for an outstanding flavor.</p>
